# ASD
My attempts (some successful, some not yet) to implement (in C) the algorithms and data structures I learnt about during the "Algorytmy i Struktury Danych" (ASD) course at AGH UST:
* bst - binary search trees and red-black trees; finished
* graphs - basic graph algorithms; finished
* huffman - attempt at implementing Huffman coding; doesn't work, maybe one day I'll return to this project
* sort - multiple sorting algorithms, with speed comparison; finished
